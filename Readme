To run this model you need: python ==3.9
  torch                        1.12.1  
  torch_geometric              2.5.2  
  d2l                          1.0.3
  numpy                        1.23.5
  pandas                       2.0.3

#Step1: Process your data, only retain user_id, item_id, item_category, behavior_type.




#Step 2: Run the data_change file, which can help you divide the dataset by action type.



#Step 3:Input your data(After Step1) into creat_initial.py to help you finish the pretrain part
#ATTENTION you need to set the column names in this format.
#['user', 'item', 'category', 'action', 'timestamp']


#Step 4:Edit the config and set the path of config in cascade_model.py. Then run the cascade_model
python cascade.py


#Step 5:Run evalute_final.py,This is the self-attention part,through this part you can get the final result.
python evaluate_final.py
